<p>The dotplots were created using d3.js, an open source
javascript library for creating data driven documents. The charts are rendered
as scalable graphics by the browser using open web standards. D3.js has a steep
learning curve (particularly for someone like me, with no javascript
experience), however it is a very powerful library. See some amazing examples
of d3.js in action at the <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/multimedia/index.html">New York Times</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery">d3js.org</a>.</p>

<p>The treemaps, motion charts, and annotated timelines were
created using the R statistical environment package googleVis. The googleVis
package serves as an interface between R and the Google visualization API,
which allows the user to create interactive charts based on R data and using R
syntax. The charts are drawn in the browser using Google's API, but all of the
data is stored in the page and is never placed or stored on Google's servers.</p>

<p>The GeoCharts were created using the GoogleMaps API v3. The
data is contained in the page, and drawn on top of Google Map elements. For
security reasons, all data used in these examples is dummy data.</p>
